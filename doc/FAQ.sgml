<sect>Frequently Asked Questions

<sect1>What is sqlmap?

<p>
sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the
process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over
of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche
features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches
lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the
database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands
on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

<sect1>How do I execute sqlmap?

<p>
If you are running on a Unix/Linux system type the following command
from a terminal:
<tscreen><verb>
python sqlmap.py -h
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
If you are running on a Windows system type the following command
from a terminal:
<tscreen><verb>
C:\Python26\python.exe sqlmap.py -h
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Where <tt>C:\Python26</tt> is the path where you installed <htmlurl
url="http://www.python.org" name="Python"> <bf>>= 2.6</bf>.

<sect1>Can I integrate sqlmap with a security tool I am developing?

<p>
Yes. sqlmap is released under the terms of the GPLv2, which means that any
derivative work must be distributed without further restrictions on the
rights granted by the GPL itself. If this constitutes a problem, feel free
to contact us so we can find a solution.

<sect1>How can I integrate sqlmap with my own tool?

<p>
TODO

<sect1>Will you support other database management systems?

<p>
Yes. There are plans to support also IBM DB2, Informix and Ingres at some
point.

<sect1>How can I occasionally contribute?

<p>
All help is greatly appreciated. First of all download the tool, make sure
you are running the latest development version from the Subversion
repository, read the user's manual carefully, have fun with it during your
penetration tests.
If you find bugs or have ideas for possible improvements, feel free to
<htmlurl url="http://www.sqlmap.org/#ml" name="get in touch on the
mailing list">. Many people have <htmlurl
url="https://svn.sqlmap.org/sqlmap/trunk/sqlmap/doc/THANKS"
name="contributed"> in different ways to the sqlmap development.
<bf>You</bf> can be the next!

<sect1>Can I actively contribute in the long-term development?

<p>
Yes, we are looking for people who can write some clean Python code, are
up to do security research, know about web application security, database
assessment and takeover, software refactoring and are motivated to join
the development team.
If this sounds interesting to you, <htmlurl
url="http://www.sqlmap.org/#developers" name="get in touch">!

<sect1>How can I support the development?

<p>
If you think that sqlmap is a great tool, it really played well during
your penetration tests, or you simply like it, you, or your boss, can
<htmlurl url="http://www.sqlmap.org/#donate" name="donate
some money"> to the developers via PayPal.

<sect1>Can you hack a site for me?

<p>
<bf>No</bf>.

<sect1>When sqlmap will switch to the Python 3?

<p>
Currently there is no huge pressure on Python projects to switch to the new
version of Python interpreter, as the process of switching, especially on
larger projects can be cumbersome (due to the few backward incompatibilities).
The switch will take place eventually, but currently it's a very low priority task.

<sect1>What does <tt>"WARNING unknown charset '...'"</tt> mean?

<p>
sqlmap needs to properly decode page content to be able to properly 
detect and deal with internationalized characters. In some cases web developers
are doing mistakes when declaring used web page charset (e.g. <tt>iso_8859</tt> instead 
of standardized name <tt>iso-8859</tt>), which can cause problems. As a failsafe mechanism
we've incorporated heuristic detection engine
<htmlurl url="http://chardet.feedparser.org/" name="chardet">, 
so in most cases sqlmap will deal with this kind of problems automatically.
Nevertheless, you are strongly advised to report us back those typographic "mistakes" 
so we could handle them manually inside the code.

<sect1>How to use sqlmap with <tt>mod_rewrite</tt> enabled?

<p>
Just put * to the place where sqlmap should check for injections in URI 
itself. In example: <tt>./sqlmap.py -u "www.site.com/id1/1*/id2/2"</tt> sqlmap 
will try to inject the payloads just at that place marked with * character.

<sect1>Why is sqlmap not able to get password hashes in some cases?

<p>
You most probably don't have enough permissions for querying on a system 
table containing password hashes.

<p>
Question(s):
<htmlurl url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.sqlmap/714" name="#1">

<sect1>What is <tt>-</tt><tt>-text-only</tt> switch?

<p>
Switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-text-only</tt> is used for removing non-textual data (tags, 
javascripts, styles,...) from the retrieved page content to further 
improve detection capabilities.

<p>
Question(s):
<htmlurl url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.sqlmap/699" name="#1">

<sect1>sqlmap is retrieving weird characters for even simplest data (e.g. <tt>--banner</tt>)?

<p>
If everything you retrieve from the target is garbled, then you are 
most probably dealing with false positive blind injection. Please 
report the problem to the <htmlurl url="mailto:dev@sqlmap.org" name="developers">.

<sect1>I am getting <tt>"CRITICAL connection timed"</tt> while I am able to browse 
the site normally?

<p>
There are few IDSes that filter out all sqlmap requests based on default 
User-Agent HTTP header used (e.g. <tt>"User-agent: sqlmap/1.0-dev"</tt>). To prevent this
kind of situations you are advised to use switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-random-agent</tt>.
If you are getting those kind of messages for all targets then you
most probably need to properly set up your proxy settings (switches <tt>-</tt><tt>-proxy</tt>
and/or <tt>-</tt><tt>-ignore-proxy</tt>)

<p>
Question(s):
<htmlurl url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.sqlmap/1241" name="#1">

<sect1>Is it possible to use <tt>"INSERT/UPDATE"</tt> SQL commands via <tt>-</tt><tt>-sql-query</tt>
and/or <tt>-</tt><tt>-sql-shell</tt>?

<p>
It is possible to use those commands, but only if the stacked injection is supported
by the vulnerable target.

<p>
Question(s):
<htmlurl url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.sqlmap/1237" name="#1">

<sect1>I am getting <tt>"finally: SyntaxError: invalid syntax"</tt> when trying to run sqlmap?

<p>
You are most probably using outdated version of Python. sqlmap is generally
supported by Python versions in range 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7, while you are strongly
advised to use versions 2.6 and 2.7.

<p>
Question(s):
<htmlurl url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.sqlmap/1231" name="#1">

<sect1>sqlmap is not able to detect/exploit injection while other commercial tools are?

<p>
Currently there are only two of us working on a pure good will and donating our 
free time to the community. If you are not willing to help us achive better tool
you are strongly advised to buy those commercial tool(s) and just 
forget about the sqlmap.
