    Replaces all occurrences of operator equal ('=') with 'LIKE' counterpart

    Tested against:
        * Microsoft SQL Server 2005
        * MySQL 4, 5.0 and 5.5

    Notes:
        * Useful to bypass weak and bespoke web application firewalls that
          filter the equal character ('=')
        * The LIKE operator is SQL standard. Hence, this tamper script
          should work against all (?) databases

    >>> tamper('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1')
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id LIKE 1'
